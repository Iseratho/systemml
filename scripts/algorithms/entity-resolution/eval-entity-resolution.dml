# THIS SCRIPT EVALUATES THE PREDICTIONS OF THE ENTITY RESOLUTION AGAINST THE GROUND TRUTH
#
# INPUT PARAMETERS:
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# NAME  TYPE   DEFAULT  MEANING
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# FX    String  ---     Location to read the frame of the predictions
#                       Each line contains comma separated ids of one matched pair
#                       Remainig columns (>2) are ignored
# FY    String  ---     Location to read the frame of the ground truth
#                       Each line contains comma separated ids of one matched pair
#                       Remainig columns (>2) are ignored
# MX    String  ---     Location to read the frame of the transformation created during entity resolution
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# OUTPUT: prints different evaluation metrics (accuracy, F1)
